      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Exploring the Mysteries of Black Holes</h1>
      <p className="mb-3">
        Black holes are one of the most fascinating and mysterious objects in the universe. They are regions in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from them.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">What is a Black Hole?</h2>
      <p className="mb-3">
        A black hole forms when a massive star collapses under its own gravity at the end of its life cycle. This collapse leads to a point of infinite density called a singularity, surrounded by an event horizon, beyond which nothing can escape.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Types of Black Holes</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-3">
        <li><strong>Stellar Black Holes:</strong> Formed by the gravitational collapse of a massive star.</li>
        <li><strong>Supermassive Black Holes:</strong> Found at the centers of galaxies, including our Milky Way.</li>
        <li><strong>Intermediate Black Holes:</strong> A class of black holes whose masses are between stellar and supermassive.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Why Study Black Holes?</h2>
      <p className="mb-3">
        Studying black holes helps scientists understand the fundamental laws of physics, including gravity, and the evolution of galaxies. They also challenge our understanding of space, time, and the limits of scientific knowledge.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        Black holes continue to intrigue and inspire scientists and the general public alike, as we strive to unlock the secrets of the universe.
